graphics! either encode primitive operations as text, or send frames

short hashes for urls

caches for past visualizations (probably don't cache 10 times to see if randomized/time-dependent)

figure out suspend/resume (e.g. for exception handling, data structures)

allow selective visualization of contents of some built-in classes

inner classes, local classes, anonymous classes, lambdas, captured final variables, this$ ...
- right now we show things exactly from JDWP, like Eclipse or NetBeans
- no way to recover all lambda arg names given current bytecode
- could desugar 2 frames into one and pass "this" to nicen a bit
- here's a class that throws a JWDP exception in both java 7 and 8

public class JWDP32 {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      // x needs to be final, but not a compile-time constant
      final int x = Math.random() < 2 ? 42 : -42;
      Object anon = new Object(){int f(){return x;}};
      class Local{int g(){return x;}}
      Local loc = new Local();
   }
}
