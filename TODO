only add a border to stacks/queues if they're embedded within another object

examples for ST / better documentation on main page about supported classes/libraries

graphics! either encode primitive operations as text, or send frames

short hashes for urls

caches for past visualizations (probably don't cache 10 times to see if randomized/time-dependent)

should allow to access java.util.Stack etc

inner classes, local classes, anonymous classes, lambdas, captured final variables, this$ ...
lambdas:
- desugar 2 frames into one and pass "this", doable
- skip frames that don't make sense, doable
- replace random name with defining source line, doable if called, but annoying
- replace arg$1 etc with actual captured variable name. no idea!

figure out suspend/resume (e.g. for exception handling, data structures)

selective visualization of contents of some built-in classes?

nested visualization option?
